"""EasyMagpieTTS pipeline topologies for vLLM-Omni.

EasyMagpie LM reports the generic ``model_type="nemotron_h"``, so routing uses
its HF architecture or an explicit ``pipeline: …`` deployment setting.

* :data:`EASYMAGPIE_PIPELINE` — two-stage text → acoustic codes → waveform.
* :data:`EASYMAGPIE_LM_PIPELINE` — single-stage acoustic-token
  prediction only (no in-engine Code2Wav). Use this to benchmark and develop
  EasyMagpie LM in isolation; select it with ``pipeline: easymagpie_lm``.
