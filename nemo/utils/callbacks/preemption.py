    PreemptionCallback class creates a callback that checks for preemption during training at the end of every step.
    Upon preemption the callback provides a function to gracefully exit the training immediately and also saves the
    current state in a checkpoint as *last.ckpt.
    (to be able to start from the same step without wasting any compute while resuming the next time).

    PreemptionCallback is always enabled by default via the arg create_preemption_callback under ExpManagerConfig.
