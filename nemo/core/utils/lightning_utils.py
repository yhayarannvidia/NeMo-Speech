def read_batch(dataloader_iter: Iterator, model: pl.LightningModule) -> Tuple[Any, int]:
    """Pull the next batch from a Lightning ``dataloader_iter`` and apply the
    device/precision conversions that ``_PrefetchDataFetcher`` would have
    applied for the default ``training_step(batch, batch_idx)`` signature.

    Use this from a ``training_step(self, dataloader_iter)``-style step. That
    signature makes Lightning select ``_DataLoaderIterDataFetcher`` (no
    prefetch), which is required for bit-identical checkpoint resumption with
    a stateful dataloader: the default ``_PrefetchDataFetcher`` re-primes one
    batch on every iter init (including on resume), advancing the stateful
    dataloader past the saved snapshot point and giving the resumed run a
    one-batch drift versus the continuous run.

    Also checks shutdown conditions before pulling the next batch. Lightning
    still calls timer and preemption callbacks in normal ``dataloader_iter``
    runs, but checking here closes the deadline/preemption window before user
    code advances a stateful iterator. If the time budget is already exhausted
    or preemption was already signaled, the helper saves ``last.ckpt`` and
    exits before another sample is consumed.

    Args:
        dataloader_iter: The iterator passed by Lightning into a
            ``training_step(self, dataloader_iter)`` (an instance of
            ``_DataFetcherWrapper``). Yields ``(batch, batch_idx, dataloader_idx)``.
        model: The ``LightningModule`` whose ``trainer`` carries the precision
            plugin and strategy used to move the batch to device.

    Returns:
        ``(batch, batch_idx)`` — batch is already converted to the right
        precision and moved to the model's device, ready for forward.
