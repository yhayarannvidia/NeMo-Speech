    """Patch flashoptim to handle FSDP2 unevenly-sharded parameters in DCP.

    FlashOptim <= 0.1.3 raises ``ValueError`` when saving optimizer state for
    parameters whose shard dimension is not evenly divisible by the FSDP mesh
    size. The root cause is that ``DTensor.from_local()`` is called without an
    explicit ``shape``, so it infers ``global = local * mesh_size`` which is
    wrong for padded (uneven) shards.

    This patch replaces ``_wrap_state_as_dtensor`` on the optimizer class so
    that ``shape=param.shape`` and ``stride=param.stride()`` are always passed,
    which is correct for both even and uneven shards.
