    A Lhotse-based dataset for audio codec model training.

    It is a simple dataset that mostly just loads the audio samples.
    In addition, it performs the following operations:
    * Resampling to the target sample rate
    * Random truncation of each cut's `target_audio` to a fixed duration
    * Sanity checks on the audio

    The operations below are handled directly by Lhotse according to the configuration
    applied in `AudioCodecModel._get_lhotse_dataloader()`:
    * Minimum duration filtering
    * Any additional transformations configured in Lhotse during its construction are
      applied to the audio as it is loaded in `load_audio()`.
