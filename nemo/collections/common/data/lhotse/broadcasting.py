"""CP/TP-aware data loading.

Under context-parallel (CP) and tensor-parallel (TP) training, all ranks in
the same ``(cp, tp)`` sub-mesh of a DP slot must process the **same** global
batch each step — CP shards the sequence dimension and TP shards the
feature dimension, so a divergent global batch breaks the per-rank shape
contract that CP/TP collectives assume.

The fix: construct the dataloader on a single DP-source rank per slot and
broadcast each batch over NCCL to the other ranks in the ``(cp, tp)``
sub-mesh, eliminating the entire class of nondeterminism bug regardless of
source (Lhotse ``concurrent_bucketing``, ``shard_seed: randomized``, worker
scheduling jitter, etc.).

:class:`BroadcastingDataLoader` is the single-class API:

    # In the datamodule:
    return BroadcastingDataLoader(
        source=real_loader if is_dp_source_rank(mesh) else None,
        device_mesh=mesh,
    )

The wrapper hides the broadcast bookkeeping. ``state_dict`` /
``load_state_dict`` are delegated to the source loader on the source rank,
so checkpoint/resume works transparently with ``DataLoader``,
``torchdata.StatefulDataLoader``, or any other source object that
implements those methods.

Iteration termination is handled with two broadcasts per step: a
continue/stop boolean followed by the batch. This works regardless of
whether the source loader exposes ``__len__`` (Lhotse training loaders
typically don't).
