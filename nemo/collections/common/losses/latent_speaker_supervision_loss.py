class LatentSpeakerSupervisionLoss(Loss):
    """
    Combined loss for SOT (Serialized Output Training) multi-speaker ASR that provides:

        1. Standard smoothed cross-entropy loss on **segment-level** SOT labels
        2. Auxiliary per-word speaker classification loss (latent speaker supervision)

    Motivation:
        In SOT-based multi-speaker ASR, there are two labeling strategies:

        - **Word-level SOT**: A speaker token precedes every word.
          e.g. ``<spk:0> hi <spk:0> how <spk:0> are <spk:0> you <spk:1> I <spk:1> am ...``
          (+) More speaker-label gradients  (-) Very token-inefficient

        - **Segment-level SOT**: Speaker tokens appear only at speaker changes.
          e.g. ``<spk:0> hi how are you <spk:1> I am good thanks``
          (+) Token-efficient  (-) Fewer speaker-label gradients

        This loss gives the **best of both worlds**: the labels remain segment-level
        (efficient token throughput), but an auxiliary loss provides speaker supervision
        at every word position (strong speaker gradients), without generating extra
        speaker tokens at inference time.

    How it works:
        For each word position in the label sequence, the "active speaker" is determined
        by forward-filling the last observed speaker token. The model's log-probabilities
        for the speaker token vocabulary are extracted, renormalized, and a cross-entropy
        loss is computed against the active speaker. This is combined with the standard
        CE loss via a configurable weight.

    Args:
        speaker_token_ids: List of token IDs for speaker tokens
            (e.g., IDs for ``<spk:0>``, ``<spk:1>``, ``<spk:2>``, ``<spk:3>``).
        speaker_loss_weight: Weight for the auxiliary speaker supervision loss.
        include_ce_loss: If True (default), the forward pass returns standard CE + speaker loss.
            If False, returns **only** the auxiliary speaker loss (useful when a separate
            CE loss module is already applied, e.g. ``self.loss`` in the model).
        pad_id: Padding token ID (used to create output_mask if not provided).
        label_smoothing: Label smoothing coefficient for the standard CE loss (only used when
            ``include_ce_loss=True``).
        speaker_label_smoothing: Label smoothing coefficient for the speaker CE loss.
        eps: Small constant to avoid division by zero.
        per_token_reduction: If True, reduces loss per token; if False, returns per-token losses.
        per_speaker_normalization: If True, the speaker supervision loss is computed as the
            mean of per-speaker average losses, giving equal importance to each speaker
            regardless of how many words they have. For example, if speaker 0 has 2 words
            and speaker 1 has 20 words, each speaker still contributes 50% of the loss.
            Default: True.
