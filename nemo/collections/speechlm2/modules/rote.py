    RoTE is RoPE with the token index replaced by the absolute timestamp in seconds:
    ``θ ← −τ·2π`` instead of ``θ ← −i·2π``. Each channel pair rotates at its own frequency
    (the "clock-hands" analogy from the paper): for channel pair ``k`` and timestamp ``τ`` in
    seconds, the rotation angle is ``−τ · 2π · (1 / theta^(2k/rotary_dim))``.

    Args:
        dim: Feature dimension of the ``(Batch, Time, Channel)`` input (channel dimension ``C``). Should be equal to encoder output dim size.
        theta: Base of the geometric frequency progression (RoPE ``rope_theta``). Defaults to the Audio Flamingo Next value ``1200.0``.
        rotary_fraction: Fraction of ``dim`` to rotate (RoPE ``partial_rotary_factor``). The rotated
            width is rounded down to an even number. Defaults to the Audio Flamingo Next value ``0.2``.
