"""vLLM plugin registration for NeMo Speech LM (SALM) models.

Registers ``NeMoSpeechLMConfig`` and the single
``NeMoSpeechLMForConditionalGeneration`` model class with vLLM via the
``vllm.general_plugins`` entry point.

A single model class covers every supported backbone family (standard
decoder-only LLMs like Qwen3, hybrid Mamba+MoE like NemotronH).
Backbone-specific behavior is selected at instantiation time.
