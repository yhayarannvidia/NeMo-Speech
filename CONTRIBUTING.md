# Contributions are welcome!

We do all of NeMo's development in the open. Contributions from NeMo community are welcome.


# Pull Requests (PR) Guidelines

**Send your PRs to the `main` branch**

1) Make sure your PR does one thing. Have a clear answer to "What does this PR do?".
2) Read General Principles and style guide below
3) Make sure you sign your commits. E.g. use ``git commit -s`` when before your commit
4) Make sure relevant unittests finish successfully before sending PR
5) Send your PR and request a review

## Signing Your Work

All contributions must be signed off to certify agreement with the Developer Certificate of Origin below. Add a
`Signed-off-by` trailer to each commit by using `git commit -s`.

Developer Certificate of Origin
Version 1.1

Copyright (C) 2004, 2006 The Linux Foundation and its contributors.

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed.


Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1

By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

(a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I
    have the right to submit it under the open source license
    indicated in the file; or

(b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best
    of my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source
    license and I have the right under that license to submit that
    work with modifications, whether created in whole or in part
    by me, under the same open source license (unless I am
    permitted to submit under a different license), as indicated
    in the file; or

(c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other
    person who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified
    it.

(d) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution
    are public and that a record of the contribution (including all
    personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
    maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
    this project or the open source license(s) involved.

## Unit tests
Quick tests (locally, while developing)
```
pytest
# If you don't have NVIDIA GPU do:
# pytest -m "not pleasefixme" --cpu path/to/relevant_tests
```
Full tests, including pre-trained model downloads
```
pytest -m "not pleasefixme" --with_downloads  path/to/relevant_tests
```

Replace `path/to/relevant_tests` with the test directory to run such as `tests/collections/asr`. Check the test scripts in `tests/functional_tests`
that begin with `L0_Unit_Tests_` for the specific test configuration used by different parts of the unit test suite. Different suites may expect
different environment variables to be set.

## Running the Github CI

CI is powered by [copy-pr-bot](https://github.com/apps/copy-pr-bot), which mirrors each PR to a `pull-request/<number>` branch and triggers the workflow on push.

**CI runs automatically** when all of the following are true:
- Every commit in the PR is [GPG-signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification)
- Every committer is a member of the NVIDIA-NeMo GitHub org (or listed as an `additional_trustee`)
- The PR has no more than 249 commits

If any of those conditions are not met, copy-pr-bot posts a comment and skips branch creation — CI will not run. A maintainer (anyone with write access or greater) can trigger it manually by commenting:
```
/ok to test <sha>
```
where `<sha>` is the full or abbreviated SHA of the PR's HEAD commit. The bot also accepts `/okay to test` and `/ok-to-test`.

To re-run CI after a new push, the bot will sync automatically if the PR is still trusted. Otherwise comment `/ok to test <sha>` again with the new HEAD SHA.

The CI test suites are selectively ran based on the files that are changed. In some cases, no tests may be ran such as when docs are updated.

Lint checks using flake8 and pylint are ran on the code based on the files that were changed. Please resolve any lint errors. It is possible but discouraged
to ignore the lint errors by adding the "skip-linting" label to the PR.

To run the nightly e2e test suite on a PR, add the "Run e2e nightly" label. Labels are read once by the `pre-flight` job at the start of each run, so the label must be present before CI starts. If CI is already running when you add the label, cancel the active workflow run and re-trigger by pushing a new commit.

## Whom should you ask for review:
Please tag @nithinraok for NeMo core and ASR related PRs and @blisc for TTS related PRs.

Note that some people may self-assign to review your PR - in which case, please wait for them to add a review.

Your  pull requests must pass all checks and peer-review before they can be merged.

# General principles
1. **User-oriented**: make it easy for end users, even at the cost of writing more code in the background
1. **Robust**: make it hard for users to make mistakes.
1. **Well-tested**: please add simple, fast unittests. Consider adding CI tests for end-to-end functionality.
1. **Reusable**: for every piece of code, think about how it can be reused in the future and make it easy to be reused.
1. **Readable**: code should be easier to read.
1. **Legal**: if you copy even one line of code from the Internet, make sure that the code allows the license that NeMo supports. Give credit and link back to the code.
1. **Sensible**: code should make sense. If you think a piece of code might be confusing, write comments.

## Class naming conventions
* No “I”, “Interface”, “NM” nor “NeMo” pre/postfixes anywhere
* Core interfaces have simple names: Typing, Cloud, Serialization, FileIO*
* Core classes have the simplest names ever: NeuralModule, Model, Graph, Dataset, Loss, Module*
* Abstract classes in the Model hierarchy have Model postfix
* A config class for MyModel should be called MyModelConfig
* Leaf Neural Module classes have simple names without any postfixes (e.g. AudioPreprocess)
* Leaf Datasets have Dataset postfix (e.g. AudioToSpeechLabelDataset)
* Leaf Losses have Loss postfix (e.g. CTCLoss)
* Leaf Models do not have any postfix, just name (e.g. QuartzNet)

## Python style
We use ``black`` as our style guide. To check whether your code will pass style check (from the NeMo's repo folder) run:
``python setup.py style --scope path/to/changed/files`` and if it does not pass run ``python setup.py style --scope path/to/changed/files --fix``.

1. Include docstrings for every class and method exposed to the user.
1. Use Python 3 type hints for every class and method exposed to the user.
1. Avoid wild import: ``from X import *`` unless in ``X.py``, ``__all__`` is defined.
1. Minimize the use of ``**kwargs``.
1. ``RaiseError`` is preferred to ``assert``. Write: ```if X: raise Error``` instead of ```assert X```.
1. Classes are preferred to standalone methods.
1. Methods should be atomic. A method shouldn't be longer than 75 lines, e.g. can be fit into the computer screen without scrolling.
1. If a method has arguments that don't fit into one line, each argument should be in its own line for readability.
1. Add ``__init__.py`` for every folder.
1. F-strings are prefered to formatted strings.
1. Loggers are preferred to print. In NeMo, you can use logger from ``from nemo.utils import logging``
1. Private functions (functions start with ``_``) shouldn't be called outside its host file.
1. If a comment lasts multiple lines, use ``'''`` instead of ``#``.

# Collections
Collection is a logical grouping of related Neural Modules. It is a grouping of modules that share a domain area or semantics.
When contributing module to a collection, please make sure it belongs to that category.
If you would like to start a new one and contribute back to the platform, you are very welcome to do so.
